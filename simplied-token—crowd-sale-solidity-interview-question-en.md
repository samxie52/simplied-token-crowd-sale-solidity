## Basic Solidity Questions (Q1-Q40)

### Q1: What is the difference between `memory` and `storage` in Solidity?
**Answer:** `storage` refers to persistent state variables stored on the blockchain, while `memory` is temporary data that exists only during function execution. Storage is expensive to modify, memory is cheaper but temporary.

### Q2: Explain the `payable` modifier in Solidity functions.
**Answer:** The `payable` modifier allows a function to receive Ether. Without it, the function will reject any Ether sent to it and revert the transaction.

### Q3: What is the purpose of the `view` modifier?
**Answer:** `view` indicates that a function reads state but doesn't modify it. It can be called without creating a transaction and doesn't cost gas when called externally.

### Q4: What is the difference between `require()` and `assert()` in Solidity?
**Answer:** `require()` is used for input validation and refunds remaining gas on failure. `assert()` is for internal errors and consumes all gas on failure. Use `require()` for user input validation, `assert()` for invariants.

### Q5: Explain the concept of function visibility in Solidity.
**Answer:** Solidity has four visibility levels: `public` (accessible from anywhere), `external` (only from outside the contract), `internal` (within contract and derived contracts), and `private` (only within the current contract).

### Q6: What is a modifier in Solidity and how is it used?
**Answer:** A modifier is reusable code that can be applied to functions to change their behavior. It's commonly used for access control, input validation, and state checks. The `_` symbol represents where the function body executes.

### Q7: What is the difference between `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`?
**Answer:** `msg.sender` is the immediate caller of the function (can be a contract or EOA), while `tx.origin` is always the original external account that initiated the transaction. Using `tx.origin` for authorization is a security anti-pattern.

### Q8: Explain what happens during contract deployment in Solidity.
**Answer:** During deployment, the constructor runs once to initialize the contract state. The contract bytecode is stored on the blockchain at a new address, and the constructor parameters are passed to set initial values.

### Q9: What is the purpose of the `immutable` keyword?
**Answer:** `immutable` variables can only be set during construction and cannot be changed afterward. They're stored in the contract's bytecode rather than storage, making them gas-efficient for values that don't change.

### Q10: How do you handle integer overflow in Solidity 0.8+?
**Answer:** Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection that automatically reverts transactions on arithmetic overflow. For older versions, SafeMath library was required.

### Q11: What is the difference between `call`, `delegatecall`, and `staticcall`?
**Answer:** `call` executes code in the target contract's context, `delegatecall` executes target code in the caller's context (preserving msg.sender and storage), `staticcall` is like call but doesn't allow state modifications.

### Q12: Explain the concept of events in Solidity.
**Answer:** Events are a way to log information on the blockchain. They're cheaper than storage, can be filtered and searched by external applications, and provide a way for contracts to communicate with the outside world.

### Q13: What is the `fallback` function and when is it called?
**Answer:** The fallback function is called when a contract receives Ether without data or when a function that doesn't exist is called. In Solidity 0.6+, there's also a `receive` function specifically for plain Ether transfers.

### Q14: How do you implement inheritance in Solidity?
**Answer:** Use the `is` keyword to inherit from parent contracts. Solidity supports multiple inheritance with C3 linearization. Child contracts can override parent functions using the `override` keyword.

### Q15: What is the purpose of the `virtual` keyword?
**Answer:** `virtual` indicates that a function can be overridden by derived contracts. Functions marked as virtual can have their implementation changed in child contracts using the `override` keyword.

### Q16: Explain gas optimization techniques in Solidity.
**Answer:** Key techniques include: using `uint256` instead of smaller uints, packing structs efficiently, using `external` over `public` for functions, avoiding loops in favor of mappings, and using `immutable`/`constant` for unchanging values.

### Q17: What is the difference between `constant` and `immutable`?
**Answer:** `constant` variables must be assigned at compile time and are replaced by their values in bytecode. `immutable` variables can be assigned during construction and are stored in bytecode but not in storage slots.

### Q18: How do you implement access control in Solidity?
**Answer:** Common patterns include: simple owner-based control with `onlyOwner` modifier, role-based access control (RBAC) using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl, and multi-signature patterns for critical operations.

### Q19: What is reentrancy and how do you prevent it?
**Answer:** Reentrancy occurs when a contract calls an external contract that calls back into the original contract before the first call completes. Prevent it using the checks-effects-interactions pattern or ReentrancyGuard.

### Q20: Explain the difference between `transfer`, `send`, and `call` for sending Ether.
**Answer:** `transfer` (2300 gas, reverts on failure), `send` (2300 gas, returns boolean), `call` (forwards all gas, returns boolean and data). `call` is now recommended for sending Ether due to gas limit flexibility.

### Q21: What is the purpose of the `constructor` function?
**Answer:** The constructor is a special function that runs only once during contract deployment. It initializes the contract's state variables and cannot be called after deployment. It can have parameters to set initial values.

### Q22: How do you handle errors and exceptions in Solidity?
**Answer:** Use `require()` for input validation, `revert()` with custom error messages, `assert()` for invariants, and custom errors (0.8.4+) for gas-efficient error handling. Try-catch blocks can handle external call failures.

### Q23: What is the difference between `block.timestamp` and `block.number`?
**Answer:** `block.timestamp` returns the current block's timestamp (in seconds since Unix epoch), while `block.number` returns the current block number. Timestamp can be manipulated by miners within ~15 seconds.

### Q24: Explain the concept of function selectors in Solidity.
**Answer:** Function selectors are the first 4 bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature. They're used to identify which function to call in the contract's bytecode during transaction execution.

### Q25: What is the `unchecked` block in Solidity 0.8+?
**Answer:** `unchecked` blocks disable automatic overflow/underflow checks for arithmetic operations within the block, reverting to pre-0.8 behavior. Use carefully when you're certain overflow won't occur to save gas.

### Q26: How do you implement a simple state machine in Solidity?
**Answer:** Use an enum to define states and a state variable to track current state. Implement modifiers to check valid states and functions to transition between states with proper validation.

### Q27: What is the difference between `abi.encode` and `abi.encodePacked`?
**Answer:** `abi.encode` produces ABI-compliant encoding with padding, while `abi.encodePacked` produces tightly packed encoding without padding. `encodePacked` can lead to hash collisions and should be used carefully.

### Q28: Explain the concept of proxy patterns in Solidity.
**Answer:** Proxy patterns separate logic and storage, allowing contract upgrades. The proxy contract holds state and delegates calls to an implementation contract. Common patterns include transparent proxy and UUPS proxy.

### Q29: What is the `selfdestruct` function and when should it be used?
**Answer:** `selfdestruct` destroys a contract and sends its Ether to a specified address. It should be used rarely, only for emergency situations or planned contract lifecycle management, as it's irreversible.

### Q30: How do you implement time-based restrictions in Solidity?
**Answer:** Use `block.timestamp` with require statements to check time conditions. Be aware of miner manipulation possibilities (~15 seconds) and consider using block numbers for longer time periods.

### Q31: What is the difference between `public` and `external` function visibility?
**Answer:** `public` functions can be called both internally and externally, creating internal and external interfaces. `external` functions can only be called from outside the contract, making them more gas-efficient for external calls.

### Q32: Explain the concept of libraries in Solidity.
**Answer:** Libraries are reusable code that can be deployed once and used by multiple contracts. They cannot hold state variables or receive Ether. Use `using LibraryName for Type` to attach library functions to types.

### Q33: What is the purpose of the `pure` modifier?
**Answer:** `pure` functions neither read from nor modify the blockchain state. They only work with their input parameters and local variables, making them deterministic and gas-free when called externally.

### Q34: How do you handle dynamic arrays in Solidity?
**Answer:** Dynamic arrays can grow and shrink using `push()` and `pop()` methods. Access elements by index, use `.length` property, and be careful with gas costs for large arrays in loops.

### Q35: What is the difference between `mapping` and `array` in Solidity?
**Answer:** Mappings are key-value stores with O(1) access but no enumeration capability. Arrays are ordered collections with enumeration but potentially expensive iteration. Choose based on access patterns.

### Q36: Explain the concept of function overloading in Solidity.
**Answer:** Solidity supports function overloading where multiple functions can have the same name but different parameter types. The compiler selects the correct function based on the argument types provided.

### Q37: What is the `receive` function in Solidity?
**Answer:** The `receive` function is called when a contract receives plain Ether (no data). It must be `external payable` and cannot have arguments or return values. It's preferred over fallback for Ether reception.

### Q38: How do you implement enumeration in Solidity?
**Answer:** Use `enum` to define a set of named constants. Enums are represented as integers internally, starting from 0. They provide type safety and make code more readable than using raw integers.

### Q39: What is the difference between `delete` and setting to zero in Solidity?
**Answer:** `delete` resets a variable to its default value and may provide gas refunds for storage cleanup. Setting to zero explicitly assigns the zero value. `delete` is generally preferred for clarity.

### Q40: Explain the concept of contract interfaces in Solidity.
**Answer:** Interfaces define function signatures without implementation. They're used to interact with external contracts in a type-safe manner. All functions in interfaces are implicitly `external` and cannot have constructors or state variables.
